Both Top and bottom use the same colorset layout.

Colorset Row 5 is the design/text.
Colorset Row 4 & 6 are the primary colors.

Top layout is reversed horizontally.  Didn't realize until I was almost done and didn't feel like re-doing the UV setup, sorry, just flip your designs.

Au Ra textures are in the top right corner.

The Normal/Mask textures (Sans designs) were baked off higher res versions of the models using XNormal,
if you want copies of them to work with, DM me on Discord. Sel#6068
